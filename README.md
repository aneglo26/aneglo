Here we can find a bit of my work done while studying data analytics, where I've developed my skils, in languages such as SQL and PYTHON, but also in data visualization tools such as Tableau.

### SQL
In regards to SQL, we can find here a some exercises done with a fictional movie rental company called Rockbuster, where we explored their data in order to find answers regarding their market and clients.

### PYTHON
Here we can find more information regarding another exercise where I combined, filter, analyzed diverse dataframes into one and used it to find answers and create strategies for another fictional company, a supermarket with many customers and clients. Most of the work has been conducted in Jupyter.

### Tableau
Here are also some links to presentations created using tableau to present conclusions of exercises done in Excel, SQL.
