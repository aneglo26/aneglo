Here is one CTE created to extract the average of amount spent in a group of cities, connecting data from different nodules:

WITH average_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, total_amount_paid) 
AS (SELECT  A.customer_id, 
            A.first_name, 
            A.last_name, 
            D.country, 
            C.city, 
            SUM (F.amount)
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id 
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id 
INNER JOIN rental E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id 
INNER JOIN payment F ON E.rental_id = F.rental_id
WHERE C.city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur') 
GROUP by D.country, C.city, A.customer_id 
ORDER by SUM (F.amount) 
DESC LIMIT 5) 
SELECT AVG (total_amount_paid) 
FROM average_cte
